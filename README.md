# Antikythera

Project to analyse, document and build the Antikythera device originally conceived and built by Andrew Carrol.

See https://youtu.be/RLPVCJjTNgk for the original build.

Steps
First: analyse the video and other online material to understand construction
Second: Reverse engineer the mechanics and construct a model in Lego software (LDCAD) 
Third: Build instructions in LPub3D and publish to Rebrickable.com (see https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-1523/WillPilgrim/antikythera-device/#comments)
Fourth: Buy parts
Fifth: Construct!
